# Automatic Tagging Stack Overflow questions
### Introduction
The primary aim of this project is to automatically tag Stack Overflow questions based on
the title and description. For example, A Stack Overflow question, which consists of a title and description
related to data science will automatically give it a relevant tag(s). The secondary problem which we will be
addressing is Information Retrieval using Topic modelling to take out the information based semantics
and context of questions.
